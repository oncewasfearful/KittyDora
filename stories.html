  <article><h2>Dora adventure 1
  </h2>
<p>
    Once upon a time when dora was still a <strong>little cat,</strong> he was very curious about the electricity and all those DC motors and stuffs, so he woke up and decided to create something great that this world had never seen before, so he collected his dc motors from his rc car,and grabed a plug and went straight to his experiment lab, he connected the plug to the wire's one end and kept the other end which wasn't insulated in his other hand and closed the door so that no one could intrupt his experiment, he then switched on...<br>
    he made such a loud noise, that all his family member came to his rescue and since cats have seven lives one life of his was consumed, he came back alive and he gained was able to gain some intelligence through the shock too.this made dora little more clam and little less wild and also a little more enlighten... warning dont try this at your home dora is a cat and he has seven lives but you don't. <br>
    will be back with more of his adventures till then you may join our server and get a chance to interact with our kitty cat dora in the vc.
